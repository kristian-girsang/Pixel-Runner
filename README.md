# Pixel Runner
This project is a simple game built using the Python programming language and the Pygame module. Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes functions for handling graphics, sound, and input, making it an ideal choice for creating games.

The game itself is a 2D platformer, where the player controls a character that can jump only. The objective of the game is to avoid as many obstacles as possible . The game also features a simple scoring system and a game over screen when the player loses all their lives.

To run the game, you will need to have Python and Pygame installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website and then use the pip package manager to install Pygame. Once you have both of these installed, you can simply run the main script to start the game.

Using the game's code is a great starting point for beginners to learn more about game development in Python and Pygame. Feel free to use the code as a base for your own projects or to learn more about game development in Python.
